As of December 2023, I have started my new position as a research scientist at [Spotify](https://research.atspotify.com/).

My research interests and experiences have spanned a wide range of topics, including information retrieval, bias and fairness, theoretical machine learning, and textual sequence to sequence modeling. A unifying thread among my research endeavors is the pursuit of a theoretical understanding of learning problems.
Currently, I focus on understanding and utilizing large language models, particularly RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and ICL (In-Context Learning), for various tasks.


## Notes
[Here](readings) I keep some highlights from the papers I read.

## PhD
I joined the [University of Amsterdam, IRLab](https://irlab.science.uva.nl/) as a Ph.D. on May 2019, under the supervision of [Prof. Maarten de Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/) and [Dr. Mostafa Dehghani](https://mostafadehghani.com/).
Our work on fair and unbiased learning to rank (LTR) from user interactions has led to several papers in SIGIR and CIKM.
We also explored overparameterization and memorization/generalization in general machine learning.

In the summer of 2022, I interned in the machine translation team at Apple and extended my experience in sequence modeling, particularly transformers and state space models.

In the final year of my PhD (i.e., 2023), I have worked on generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and retrieval augmentation techniques in music recommendation as an intern at Spotify.
