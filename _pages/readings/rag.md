## Retrieval Augmentation

### [RUEL: Retrieval-Augmented User Representation with Edge Browser Logs for Sequential Recommendation](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/ruel-retrieval-augmented-user-representation) (2023)

> we propose RUEL, a novel retrieval-based sequential recommender that can effectively incorporate external anonymous user behavior data.
...
We then design a contrastive learning framework with a momentum encoder and a memory bank to retrieve the most relevant and diverse browsing sequences from the full browsing log based on the semantic similarity between user representations. After retrieval, we apply an item-level attentive selector to filter out noisy items and generate refined sequence embeddings for the final predictor.

### [Recommender Systems with Generative Retrieval](https://shashankrajput.github.io/Generative.pdf) (2023)

> we
create semantically meaningful tuple of codewords to serve as a Semantic ID for
each item. 
Given Semantic IDs for items in a user session, a Transformer-based
sequence-to-sequence model is trained to predict the Semantic ID of the next
item that the user will interact with
