# Ali Vardasbi

I'm a PhD student at the [University of Amsterdam, IRLab](https://irlab.science.uva.nl/) working on different aspects of search and recommendation.
My supervisor is [Maarten de Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/).
Additional to search and recommendation, I am also interested in understanding generalization in the overparameterized neural networks.

I have joined UvA from May 2019.
Before that, I was a researcher at the University of Tehran, working on NLP, IR and social networks.
